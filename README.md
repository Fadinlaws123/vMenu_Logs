# FiveM vMenu
- Created by TomGrobbe

### About:
vMenu is a server-side menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support.


\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))
